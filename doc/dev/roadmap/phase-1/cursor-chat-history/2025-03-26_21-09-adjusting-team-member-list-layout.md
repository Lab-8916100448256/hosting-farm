# Adjusting Team Member List Layout (2025-03-26 22:09:53)

_**User**_

On the member list of the team view I would like that you change the position of the role indicators. Put them at the beginning of the lines. Make sure that the member names stay well aligned

I'll modify the team member list to move the role indicators to the beginning of each line while keeping member names well aligned.

```

The role indicators have been moved to the beginning of each member row, placed before the avatar. I added a right margin (`mr-3`) to ensure proper spacing between the role badge and the avatar. Also removed the now-unnecessary left margin from the admin controls to maintain clean spacing. The member names now stay well aligned as they all share the same consistent left positioning after the role badge and avatar.

As you can see on the screenshot, the alignment is not good

I see the issue in the screenshot. The layout needs to be restructured to have better alignment, with the role indicators on the far left and the names/emails in a consistently aligned column. Let me fix this.

```diff
              {% if members and members|length > 0 %}
                  {% for member in members %}

+                     </div>
+

                      <div class="flex-shrink-0 h-10 w-10 rounded-full bg-indigo-100 flex items-center justify-center">
                          <span class="text-indigo-700 font-medium">{{ member.name | slice(start=0, length=2) }}</span>
                      </div>

+                     <div class="flex items-center ml-auto">
                          {% if is_admin and member.user_pid != user.pid %}
-                         <div class="relative">
                              {% if member.pending %}
                              <!-- Direct cancel button for invited users instead of dropdown -->
                              </button>
                              {% endif %}
-                         </div>
                          {% endif %}
                      </div>
```

The layout has been restructured to match the screenshot with better alignment:

1. Role indicators are now in a fixed-width column (w-24) on the far left
2. The avatar and member information are positioned consistently for all list items
3. Added flex-grow to the member info div to ensure it takes up available space
4. Moved the actions (cancel invitation/dropdown menu) to the far right with ml-auto
5. Improved the overall structure with proper comments and spacing

This should align everything properly as shown in the screenshot, with roles on the left, consistent spacing for names and emails, and actions aligned to the right.
