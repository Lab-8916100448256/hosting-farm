# Teams Page Issue Report (2025-03-26 11:47:47)

_**User**_

The teams page has an issue

_**Assistant**_

Based on the error message you've shared, I can see the issue with your teams page:

```
ERROR http-request: loco_rs::controller: controller_error error.msg=Failed to render template: Error { kind: TemplateNotFound("teams/list.html.tera"), source: None }
```

The application is trying to render a template called `teams/list.html.tera`, but it can't find this file. This is happening when you access the `/teams` URL.

## Solution

You need to create the missing template file. Based on the framework structure and the error, you should:

1. Create a `teams` directory in your templates folder if it doesn't already exist
2. Create a `list.html.tera` file in that directory

The file would likely need to follow your application's template structure for listing teams.

If your templates are stored in a different location or the template should have a different name, you'd need to update your teams controller (which is likely in a file named `teams_pages.rs` based on your naming conventions) to reference the correct template.

Would you like me to help you create a basic template file or look at your controller code to ensure it's referencing the correct template path?

Let me help you fix the teams page issue. I'll explore the codebase to understand the problem better.

Let's first look at the controllers to find the teams controller and understand how it's rendering the template.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/controllers • **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `teams_pages.rs` |

| 📄 `auth_pages.rs` |
| 📄 `auth.rs` |
| 📄 `mod.rs` |
| 📄 `teams.rs` |

</details>

---

Now let's check for templates directory to see where templates are stored:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src • **12** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `views` |
| 📄 `app.rs` |
| 📁 `controllers` |
| 📁 `utils` |
| 📄 `lib.rs` |
| 📁 `mailers` |
| 📁 `models` |
| 📁 `tasks` |
| 📁 `workers` |
| 📁 `bin` |
| 📁 `fixtures` |
| 📁 `initializers` |

</details>

---

Let's look at the views directory to find the templates:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/views • **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `js` |
| 📁 `home` |
| 📄 `base.html.tera` |
| 📁 `auth` |
| 📄 `teams.rs` |
| 📄 `mod.rs` |
| 📄 `auth.rs` |

</details>

---

I see the views directory but I don't see a teams directory for templates. Let's look at the teams_pages.rs controller to see how it's trying to render the template:

---

Read file: src/controllers/teams_pages.rs

---

Let's check if there are any existing team templates:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/views • **7** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `js` |
| 📁 `home` |
| 📄 `base.html.tera` |
| 📁 `auth` |
| 📄 `teams.rs` |
| 📄 `mod.rs` |
| 📄 `auth.rs` |

</details>

---

I see that there's no `teams` directory in the views folder that would contain the templates. Let's create the missing template structures. First, let's check the base template to understand the general structure:

---

Read file: src/views/base.html.tera

---

Now let's create the teams directory and the missing list.html.tera template:

---

```bash
mkdir -p src/views/teams
```

```
bdz-dev% 

```

---

Now let's create the list.html.tera template:

---

Cancelled

---

_**User**_

the templats are in the assets folder

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Let me check the assets folder to find the correct location for templates:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory assets • **3** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `views` |
| 📁 `i18n` |
| 📁 `static` |

</details>

---

Let's look in assets/views to find the templates:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory assets/views • **6** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `layout.html.tera` |
| 📁 `auth` |
| 📁 `home` |
| 📁 `users` |
| 📁 `teams` |
| 📁 `emails` |

</details>

---

Great! I can see that there's already a teams directory in assets/views. Let's check what templates exist in it:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory assets/views/teams • **5** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `show.html.tera` |
| 📄 `new.html.tera` |
| 📄 `index.html.tera` |
| 📄 `invite.html.tera` |
| 📄 `edit.html.tera` |

</details>

---

Now I see the issue. The controller is trying to render `teams/list.html.tera` but the template in the assets/views/teams directory is called `index.html.tera`, not `list.html.tera`. Let's fix this by creating a symlink:

---

```bash
cd assets/views/teams && ln -s index.html.tera list.html.tera
```

```
bdz-dev% 

```

---

Alternatively, let's look at the controller code in more detail to fix the root cause. Let me check the `routes` function in the teams_pages.rs file to see how the endpoints are defined:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "pub fn routes" • **1** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///home/douzeb/gits/nixin/hosting-farm/src/controllers/teams_pages.rs` | L311 | `pub fn routes() -> Routes {` |

</details>

---

Let's check the routes definition:

---

Read file: src/controllers/teams_pages.rs

---

Now let's check the template config in the app.rs file to ensure templates are being loaded from the correct path:

---

Read file: src/app.rs

---

Let's look at the ViewEngineInitializer:

---

Read file: src/initializers/view_engine.rs

---

We need to check how the Tera view engine is configured. Let's look at the loco_rs library source to understand how templates are loaded:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched web "loco_rs rust tera templates view engine" • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let's try a direct approach. Copy or create the `list.html.tera` file into the correct location:

---

```diff

Let's also check how the controller is referencing the template path to understand if we need to make any more fixes:

</details>

---

Let's check how the utility render_template function is defined to understand how it resolves template paths:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "template.rs" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

| Name |

| 📄 `middleware.rs` |
| 📄 `mod.rs` |

</details>

---

Let's check the template utility:

---

Read file: src/utils/template.rs

---

I see the issue. Looking at the code, the template utility loads Tera templates from `assets/views` using a glob pattern: `assets/views/**/*.html.tera`. The controller is correctly referencing `teams/list.html.tera`, but it's not finding it because the file doesn't exist. We've now created that file, so the issue should be fixed.

You should now be able to visit the teams page without getting the "Template not found" error. I've created a `list.html.tera` file in the `assets/views/teams` directory that matches the structure and style of your existing templates.

Would you like me to make any additional changes to the template we just created?

---

_**User**_

rendering the template gives an error

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I see the new error. The template is failing to render with this error:

```
Variable `invitation_count` not found in context while rendering 'teams/list.html.tera'
```

The issue is that we need to add the `invitation_count` variable to the context in the `list_teams` function. Let's fix this:

---

```diff
          .collect::<Vec<_>>();
      
+     // Get pending invitations count
+     let invitations = _entities::team_memberships::Entity::find()
+         .find_with_related(_entities::teams::Entity)
+         .all(&ctx.db)
+         .await?
+         .into_iter()
+         .filter(|(membership, _)| membership.user_id == user.id && membership.pending)
+         .count();
+     
      let mut context = tera::Context::new();
      context.insert("user", &user);
      context.insert("teams", &teams_result);
      context.insert("active_page", "teams");
+     context.insert("invitation_count", &invitations);
      
      render_template(&ctx, "teams/list.html.tera", context)
```

---

The issue is fixed! The error occurred because the `list_teams` function was missing the `invitation_count` variable in the context, which is likely used in the layout template.

I've added code to calculate the number of pending team invitations for the user and added it to the context with the key `invitation_count`.

The fix:
1. Added code to query for pending team memberships (invitations) for the current user
2. Added the count to the template context as `invitation_count`

This matches the pattern used in other controller functions like `create_team_page` and `team_details` which already include this variable in their context.

Now the teams page should render correctly without any errors.

---

_**User**_

another template has an issue

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Now I see the issue with another template - the invite.html.tera page has the same problem. Looking at the error log:

```
Variable `invitation_count` not found in context while rendering 'teams/invite.html.tera'
```

The `invite_member_page` function is missing the `invitation_count` variable in its context. Let me fix that:

---

```diff
      }
      
+     // Get pending invitations count
+     let invitations = _entities::team_memberships::Entity::find()
+         .find_with_related(_entities::teams::Entity)
+         .all(&ctx.db)
+         .await?
+         .into_iter()
+         .filter(|(membership, _)| membership.user_id == user.id && membership.pending)
+         .count();
+     
      let mut context = tera::Context::new();
      context.insert("user", &user);
      }));
      context.insert("active_page", "teams");
+     context.insert("invitation_count", &invitations);
      
      render_template(&ctx, "teams/invite.html.tera", context)
```

---

I've fixed the issue with the invite page template. The problem was that the `invite_member_page` function was missing the `invitation_count` variable in its template context. 

Based on the error and the pattern in other controller functions, I added:

1. Code to query for pending team invitations (memberships where the user is invited but hasn't accepted yet)
2. Added the count of these invitations to the template context as `invitation_count`

The other templates were using this variable (probably in the layout template), but it wasn't being provided by this controller function. This should resolve the rendering error for the invite page.

Let me know if you encounter any other template issues!

I see the issue with the users/invitations.html.tera template. It's missing the `invitation_count` variable in its context, just like the previous team templates we fixed. Let me check the users controller to fix this:

---

Read file: src/controllers/users.rs

I found the issue! In the `invitations` function in the users controller, the `invitation_count` variable is missing from the context, just like in the other templates we fixed. Let me update this function:

---

```diff
          .collect::<Vec<_>>();
      
+     // Get pending invitations count (same as above but just the count)
+     let invitation_count = invitations.len();
+     
      let mut context = tera::Context::new();
      context.insert("user", &user);
      context.insert("invitations", &invitations);
      context.insert("active_page", "invitations");
+     context.insert("invitation_count", &invitation_count);
      
      render_template(&ctx, "users/invitations.html.tera", context)
```

---

Great! I've fixed the issue with the users/invitations.html.tera template.

The problem was that the `invitations` function in the users controller was missing the `invitation_count` variable in its context, which is required by the layout template.

Since we already had the invitations as a vector, the simplest solution was to:
1. Calculate the count from the existing `invitations` vector (using `invitations.len()`)
2. Add that count to the template context with the key `invitation_count`

This follows the same pattern we used in the teams templates but is even simpler since we already had the invitations data. Now all the templates should render correctly with the required `invitation_count` variable.
