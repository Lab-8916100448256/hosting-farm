# Rules Overview

The rules provided are divided into two categories:

## 1. Rust Web Application Development Rules

### UI Flow
- Use server-side rendering with HTMX
- Prefer HTMX over custom JavaScript
- Make minimal JavaScript usage, primarily for enhancing HTMX functionality

### Project Structure
- Follow classic loco-rs framework structure
- Tera templates for views are placed in assets/views/

### HTML Pages Generation
- Use Tera templates for producing HTML
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

### General Coding Best Practices
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Use clear and descriptive variable names
- Avoid complex logic without proper documentation
- Commit changes to git regularly

### Testing and Committing
- Run `cargo check` and `cargo test` after modifying Rust code
- Run `unset ARGV0` before running `cargo` to avoid proxy errors
- Don't commit changes if there are compilation errors or test failures

### Debugging
- For human interaction testing, run the application with `cargo loco start`

### Loco-rs Generation Features
- `cargo generate model` - Generate a new entity
- `cargo generate migration` - Generate a database migration
- `cargo generate controller` - Generate a controller
- `cargo generate task` - Generate a task
- `cargo generate scheduler` - Generate a scheduler
- `cargo generate worker` - Generate a worker
- `cargo generate mailer` - Generate a mailer
- `cargo generate scaffold` - Generate a full CRUD scaffold

## 2. Endpoints Naming and Structure Rules

### API Endpoints
- Must be prefixed with `/api/`
- Must return JSON responses
- Must be defined in files under `src/controllers/` ending with `.rs`
- Must not render HTML templates
- Must use `format::json()` for responses
- Must handle errors with appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses

### Human-Facing Endpoints
- Must not be prefixed with `/api/`
- Must return HTML responses
- Must be defined in files under `src/controllers/` ending with `_pages.rs`
- Must use `render_template()` for responses
- Must handle errors by re-rendering templates with error messages
- Must use form submissions for data input
- Must redirect to appropriate pages after successful actions

### Verification Checklist
- API endpoints are in files ending with `.rs`
- Human-facing endpoints are in files ending with `_pages.rs`
- API endpoints use `/api/` prefix
- Human-facing endpoints do not use `/api/` prefix
- API endpoints return JSON using `format::json()`
- Human-facing endpoints use `render_template()`
- No mixing of response types in the same controller file
