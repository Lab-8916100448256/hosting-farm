# Home Page Link Redirection Issue (2025-03-27 08:09:39)

_**User**_

In the layout that is shared by all the views, the link to the home page that is on the application title is alway directing to the unauthenticated home page.

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the layout.html.tera file to make the home page link direct to a different URL when the user is authenticated.

---

```diff
                  <div class="flex">
                      <div class="flex-shrink-0 flex items-center">
+                         {% if user %}
+                         <a href="/dashboard" class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-600">Hosting Farm</a>
+                         {% else %}
                          <a href="/" class="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-600">Hosting Farm</a>
+                         {% endif %}
                      </div>
                      <nav class="ml-6 flex space-x-8">
```

---

Now the home page link in the header will dynamically change based on authentication:
- When a user is logged in (user variable exists), clicking the "Hosting Farm" title will direct them to "/dashboard"
- When no user is logged in, clicking the title will direct them to the root path "/"
