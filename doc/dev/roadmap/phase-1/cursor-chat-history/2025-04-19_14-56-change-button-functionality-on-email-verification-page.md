# Change Button Functionality on Email Verification Page (2025-04-19 16:56:29)

_**User**_

The email verification page , rendered by handler `verify_email` in @auth_pages.rs , has a button to go to the login page. This button shoudl be to go to the profile page instead.

Okay, I understand. The email verification success page should direct the user to their profile page instead of the login page.

First, I need to find the correct URL for the profile page. I'll check the available controllers to see if a profile page controller exists.

Okay, there doesn't seem to be a dedicated `profile_pages.rs`. However, there is `users_pages.rs`, which might contain the profile page logic, or perhaps `home_pages.rs` serves as the main page after login. Let's check the routes in `users_pages.rs` first.



---

Read file: src/controllers/users_pages.rs

---

Okay, `src/controllers/users_pages.rs` has a `profile` handler function. Now I need to find the route associated with it to get the correct URL path. I'll check the `routes()` function at the end of the same file.



---

Read file: src/controllers/users_pages.rs

---



---

Great, the routes function shows that the `profile` handler is mapped to `/users/profile`.

Now I will read the `assets/views/auth/verify.html` template file to find the button and then update its `href` attribute.



---

Read file: assets/views/auth/verify.html

---

Got it. The link is on line 57:

```html
<a href="/auth/login" class="w-full flex justify-center py-2 px-4 border border-transparent rounded-md shadow-sm text-sm font-medium text-white bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-indigo-500">
    Go to Login
</a>
```

I will now change the `href` to `/users/profile` and the button text to "Go to Profile".

```diff
              </div>
              <div class="mt-6">
-                 <a href="/auth/login" class="w-full flex justify-center py-2 px-4 border border-transparent rounded-md shadow-sm text-sm font-medium text-white bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-indigo-500">
-                     Go to Login
+                 <a href="/users/profile" class="w-full flex justify-center py-2 px-4 border border-transparent rounded-md shadow-sm text-sm font-medium text-white bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-indigo-500">
+                     Go to Profile
                  </a>
              </div>
```

I have updated the button link in `assets/views/auth/verify.html` to point to `/users/profile`.

Another adjustement to perform on this  email verification page : The page is too long, the bottom cannot be viewed at the same time as the top, event if the broweser window is big enough to show everything. There is too much empty space above and below the information message container

Okay, I see. The `min-h-screen` class on the main container forces it to take the full viewport height, and the vertical padding adds extra space.

I will adjust the Tailwind CSS classes in `assets/views/auth/verify.html` to reduce the vertical spacing. Specifically, I'll remove `min-h-screen` and reduce the top/bottom padding (`py-*`) and margins (`mt-*`).



---

```diff
  
  {% block content %}
- <div class="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-50 py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
-     <div class="max-w-md w-full space-y-8">
+ <div class="flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-50 py-6 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
+     <div class="max-w-md w-full space-y-6">
          <div>
-             <h2 class="mt-6 text-center text-3xl font-extrabold text-gray-900">
+             <h2 class="mt-4 text-center text-3xl font-extrabold text-gray-900">
                  Email Verification
              </h2>
          </div>
-         <div class="mt-8 bg-white py-8 px-4 shadow sm:rounded-lg sm:px-10">
+         <div class="bg-white py-6 px-4 shadow sm:rounded-lg sm:px-10">
              <div id="infom-message">
                  {% if success %}
```

I've adjusted the classes in `assets/views/auth/verify.html` to reduce the vertical spacing. The page should now be more compact.
