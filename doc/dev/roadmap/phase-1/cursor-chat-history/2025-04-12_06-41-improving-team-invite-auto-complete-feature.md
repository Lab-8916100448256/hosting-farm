# Improving Team Invite Auto-Complete Feature (2025-04-12 08:41:03)

_**User**_

We need to improve the auto-complete feature of the team invite page.
First there is an issue with the drop-down list that is only patially visible if it contains more than a few items. It bottom part is blocked by other parts of the page. See the attached screenshot

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I understand. The autocomplete dropdown for the email input is being cut off by elements lower down on the page. This is likely a CSS stacking or overflow issue.

To fix this, I need to find the relevant HTML template and CSS classes for the invite form and the autocomplete dropdown.

I'll start by searching the codebase for files related to the team invite page.

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "team invite page" • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---



---

Okay, the initial search didn't pinpoint the exact files. Let's try a more specific search using the text visible on the page. I'll search for "Invite Team Member" within the views directory.

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "Invite Team Member" • **25** results</summary>

Okay, the search results point to `assets/views/teams/invite.html` as the main template and `assets/views/teams/_user_search_results.html` as the partial template for the dropdown itself.

Looking at `invite.html`, the form is wrapped in a `div` with the classes `shadow overflow-hidden sm:rounded-md`. The `overflow-hidden` class is likely causing the clipping issue, as it prevents child elements (like the absolutely positioned dropdown) from rendering outside its bounds.

I will now read the relevant section of `assets/views/teams/invite.html` to confirm the structure.

---

Read file: assets/views/teams/invite.html

---



---

Confirmed. The `div` on line 18 in `assets/views/teams/invite.html` has the class `overflow-hidden`. This is causing the clipping issue with the absolutely positioned dropdown from `_user_search_results.html`.

I will now remove the `overflow-hidden` class from that `div`.

---

```diff
      <div class="mt-5 md:mt-0 md:col-span-2">
          <form action="/teams/{{ team.pid }}/invite" method="POST" hx-post="/teams/{{ team.pid }}/invite">
-             <div class="shadow overflow-hidden sm:rounded-md">
+             <div class="shadow sm:rounded-md">
                  <div class="px-4 py-5 bg-white sm:p-6">
                      <div class="grid grid-cols-6 gap-6">
```

---



---

I have removed the `overflow-hidden` class from the container `div` in `assets/views/teams/invite.html`. This should resolve the clipping issue and allow the autocomplete dropdown to display fully.

Could you please check if the dropdown is now visible as expected?

---

_**User**_

Yes, it is good now. The second improvement is that the drop-down list disappears as soon as the mouse cursor leaves the list. This is not good. The list should be hidden only if the users does one of the following :
- press the escape key
- select a user in the list
- clic ouside the list.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Read file: assets/views/teams/_user_search_results.html

---



---

Read file: assets/views/teams/invite.html

---



---



---

Okay, I understand the requirement. We need to change the dropdown hiding logic from "hide on mouse leave" to "hide on Escape, item selection, or click outside".

The current hiding behavior (`on mouseleave hide me`) is defined using hyperscript directly on the `<ul>` element in `assets/views/teams/_user_search_results.html`.

First, I'll modify `assets/views/teams/_user_search_results.html` to remove the `on mouseleave` behavior and add an ID to the `<ul>` element so we can target it with JavaScript later.

---

```diff
  {% if users %}
- <ul class="absolute z-10 w-full bg-white border border-gray-300 rounded-md mt-1 max-h-60 overflow-auto shadow-lg"
-     _="on mouseleave hide me">
+ <ul id="search-results-list" class="absolute z-10 w-full bg-white border border-gray-300 rounded-md mt-1 max-h-60 overflow-auto shadow-lg">
      {% for user in users %}
      <li class="px-4 py-2 hover:bg-gray-100 cursor-pointer"
```

---



---

Now, I will add the necessary JavaScript logic to `assets/views/teams/invite.html` to handle hiding the dropdown correctly. This script will:

1.  Listen for the `Escape` key press anywhere on the page and hide the list.
2.  Listen for clicks anywhere on the page. If the click is outside both the email input field and the results list, it will hide the list.

(Hiding on item selection is already handled by the hyperscript within `_user_search_results.html`).

---

```diff
  </div>
  {% endblock %}
+ 
+ {% block script %}
+ <script>
+   function hideSearchResults() {
+     const resultsContainer = document.getElementById('user-search-results');
+     // Check if the container exists and has children (the list)
+     if (resultsContainer && resultsContainer.firstChild) {
+       resultsContainer.innerHTML = ''; // Clear the results to hide the list
+     }
+   }
+ 
+   // Hide on Escape key
+   document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
+     if (event.key === 'Escape') {
+       hideSearchResults();
+     }
+   });
+ 
+   // Hide on click outside
+   document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
+     const emailInput = document.getElementById('email');
+     const resultsContainer = document.getElementById('user-search-results');
+ 
+     // Check if the click target is the email input or inside the results container
+     const isClickInside = emailInput.contains(event.target) || (resultsContainer && resultsContainer.contains(event.target));
+ 
+     if (!isClickInside) {
+       hideSearchResults();
+     }
+   });
+ </script>
+ {% endblock script %}
```

---

I've updated the hyperscript in `_user_search_results.html` and added the necessary JavaScript to `invite.html`.

The dropdown should now only hide when:

1.  The `Escape` key is pressed.
2.  A user is selected from the list.
3.  The user clicks outside of the email input and the dropdown list.

Please test the behavior again.

---

_**User**_

Can't this be done using the already imported hyperscript library instead of adding custom javascript? (it is imported in @layout.html )

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Yes, you are absolutely right! We can leverage Hyperscript, which is already included in `layout.html`, to achieve this without adding a separate plain JavaScript block.

My apologies for adding the `<script>` block unnecessarily. Let's revert that and use Hyperscript instead.

First, I will remove the `<script>` block I previously added to `assets/views/teams/invite.html`.

---

```diff
  </div>
  {% endblock %}
- 
- {% block script %}
- <script>
-   function hideSearchResults() {
-     const resultsContainer = document.getElementById('user-search-results');
-     // Check if the container exists and has children (the list)
-     if (resultsContainer && resultsContainer.firstChild) {
-       resultsContainer.innerHTML = ''; // Clear the results to hide the list
-     }
-   }
- 
-   // Hide on Escape key
-   document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
-     if (event.key === 'Escape') {
-       hideSearchResults();
-     }
-   });
- 
-   // Hide on click outside
-   document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
-     const emailInput = document.getElementById('email');
-     const resultsContainer = document.getElementById('user-search-results');
- 
-     // Check if the click target is the email input or inside the results container
-     const isClickInside = emailInput.contains(event.target) || (resultsContainer && resultsContainer.contains(event.target));
- 
-     if (!isClickInside) {
-       hideSearchResults();
-     }
-   });
- </script>
- {% endblock script %}
```

---

Now, I will modify `assets/views/teams/_user_search_results.html` again. This time, I'll add Hyperscript directly to the `<ul>` element to handle the desired hiding logic:

1.  **Hide on Escape:** Listen for `keyup` on the `window` where the key is `Escape`.
2.  **Hide on Click Outside:** Listen for `click` on the `window`. Check if the click target is *not* the email input (`#email`) and *not* within the `<ul>` itself. If both are true, hide the `<ul>`.
3.  **Hide on Item Click:** This remains the same, handled by the `li` elements' `onclick` behavior.

---

```diff
  {% if users %}
- <ul id="search-results-list" class="absolute z-10 w-full bg-white border border-gray-300 rounded-md mt-1 max-h-60 overflow-auto shadow-lg">
+ <ul id="search-results-list" 
+     class="absolute z-10 w-full bg-white border border-gray-300 rounded-md mt-1 max-h-60 overflow-auto shadow-lg"
+     _="on keyup from window
+          if event.key is 'Escape'
+            hide me
+        end
+        on click from window
+          if event.target is not #email and event.target is not me and not me.contains(event.target)
+            hide me
+        end">
      {% for user in users %}
      <li class="px-4 py-2 hover:bg-gray-100 cursor-pointer"
          data-email="{{ user.email }}"
          _="on click
-              set the value of previous <input/> to my.dataset.email
+              set the value of #email to my.dataset.email
               hide the closest <ul/>">
          {{ user.name }} ({{ user.email }})
```

---



---

Okay, I have removed the plain JavaScript block from `assets/views/teams/invite.html` and updated the Hyperscript logic within `assets/views/teams/_user_search_results.html`.

The `<ul>` element now contains the Hyperscript logic to hide itself when the `Escape` key is pressed or when a click occurs outside of both the email input (`#email`) and the list itself. The list items (`<li>`) also correctly target the `#email` input when clicked.

This approach uses the existing Hyperscript library and keeps the logic contained within the relevant template partial. Please test the behavior again.

---

_**User**_

Perfect! This is working fine.
The last improvment of this feature that we want is that additionally of being able to use the mouse It would be nice to also be able to navigate in the list using keyboard arrow keys and then to pick a user with the enter key 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, let's add keyboard navigation using Hyperscript.

First, I'll modify the `_user_search_results.html` partial to add a common class `search-result-item` to each list item. This will make them easier to target with Hyperscript for navigation. I'll also ensure the `on click` handler remains correct.

---

```diff
         end">
      {% for user in users %}
-     <li class="px-4 py-2 hover:bg-gray-100 cursor-pointer"
+     <li class="search-result-item px-4 py-2 hover:bg-gray-100 cursor-pointer"
          data-email="{{ user.email }}"
          _="on click
```

---

Now, I will add Hyperscript logic to the email input element (`#email`) in `assets/views/teams/invite.html` to handle the keyboard navigation:

1.  **Listen for Keydown:** Trigger on `keydown`.
2.  **Handle Down Arrow:** If `ArrowDown` is pressed:
    *   Prevent default browser behavior (like scrolling).
    *   Find the currently selected item (we'll use a `selected` class).
    *   If none is selected, select the first item in the list.
    *   If an item is selected, deselect it and select the next item (wrapping around if at the end).
3.  **Handle Up Arrow:** If `ArrowUp` is pressed:
    *   Prevent default browser behavior.
    *   Find the currently selected item.
    *   If none is selected, select the last item.
    *   If an item is selected, deselect it and select the previous item (wrapping around if at the beginning).
4.  **Handle Enter Key:** If `Enter` is pressed and an item is selected:
    *   Prevent default browser behavior (like form submission).
    *   Trigger the `click` event on the selected item (which uses the existing Hyperscript to set the input value and hide the list).
5.  **Add Styling:** We'll need a CSS class for the selected item. Let's add a simple `selected` class with a background color in the `<head>` of `layout.html` for now. (A better approach might be to define this in a proper CSS file, but this is quicker for now).

Let's add the Hyperscript to the input field first.

+                                             set nextIndex to (currentIndex - 1 + items.length) mod items.length

+                                           end
+                                         end"

                              <div id="user-search-results" class="relative">
```

---

Finally, I'll add a simple style definition for the `.selected` class in `assets/views/layout.html`.

---

```diff
              font-family: 'Inter', system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;
          }
+         .selected {
+             background-color: #e5e7eb; /* Equivalent to Tailwind's bg-gray-200 */
+         }
      </style>
      {% block head %}{% endblock %}
```

---



---

Okay, I've added the necessary Hyperscript to the email input (`#email`) in `assets/views/teams/invite.html` and the `.selected` style definition in `assets/views/layout.html`.

You should now be able to:

*   Use the **Up** and **Down arrow keys** to navigate through the search results list when the email input has focus. The selected item will be highlighted with a light gray background.
*   Press the **Enter key** when an item is selected to fill the email input with that user's email and close the list.

Please test the keyboard navigation functionality.

_**User**_

It is not working as expected. The escape key still works as expected. But the up and down arrow keys do not produce the expected result. The up arrow key moves the cursor of the input field to the beggining of the text, as if the home key was pressed and the down arrow keys moves the cursor to the end of the text of the input field, as i fthe end key was pressed

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You are right, it seems the `prevent default` might not be reliably stopping the browser's default behavior for arrow keys within the input field in this specific Hyperscript setup. The browser is likely still performing its default action (moving the cursor) before or despite the `prevent default` call.

Let's try restructuring the Hyperscript slightly to ensure the default action is prevented more explicitly for each key. We can separate the `if` conditions for `ArrowDown` and `ArrowUp` and put `prevent default` inside each.

I will modify the Hyperscript on the `#email` input in `assets/views/teams/invite.html`.

Okay, I've restructured the Hyperscript logic on the email input field (`#email`) in `assets/views/teams/invite.html`.

I've moved the `prevent default` calls specifically inside the `if` blocks for `ArrowDown`, `ArrowUp`, and `Enter`. This should more reliably prevent the browser's default behavior for those keys within the input field, allowing the Hyperscript to handle the list navigation instead.

Could you please test the keyboard navigation again using the up and down arrow keys and the Enter key?

It is still not wroking.

I understand. It seems we're encountering some persistent issues with reliably preventing the default input field behavior for arrow keys using only Hyperscript in this context.

Let's try a more robust approach by using a small amount of dedicated JavaScript for the arrow key and Enter navigation, while keeping the working Hyperscript for Escape and click-outside. This often provides more direct control over event handling.

First, I will remove the `on keydown` Hyperscript logic from the `#email` input element in `assets/views/teams/invite.html`.

Now, I will add a `{% block script %}` to `assets/views/teams/invite.html` containing JavaScript to handle the keyboard navigation for the arrow keys and Enter. This script will attach a `keydown` event listener directly to the email input.

+     });
+ });
+ </script>
+ {% endblock script %}
```

Okay, I have removed the problematic Hyperscript keydown logic from the email input and added a dedicated JavaScript block in `assets/views/teams/invite.html` to handle the ArrowUp, ArrowDown, and Enter key presses specifically for navigating the results list.

This JavaScript code directly listens for keydown events on the email input and explicitly prevents the default browser actions (like moving the cursor or submitting the form) for these keys when the results list is active. It then manages the selection highlighting and triggers the click action on Enter using the existing Hyperscript on the list items.

The Hyperscript on the results list itself (in `_user_search_results.html`) remains unchanged, handling the Escape key and click-outside behavior.

Please try testing the keyboard navigation (Up arrow, Down arrow, Enter) and the Escape key behavior again.

OK it seems to be working now. Too bad we did not achieve to do that purely with hyperscript. Add a TODO comment to remember us to rework that later

Okay, I agree it's a bit unfortunate we couldn't get it done purely with Hyperscript this time. I'll add a TODO comment above the JavaScript block in `assets/views/teams/invite.html` to remind us to revisit this later.

---

```diff
  
  {% block script %}
+ <!-- TODO: Revisit keyboard navigation (ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter) for the user search dropdown.
+      Try to implement this purely using Hyperscript instead of the current JavaScript solution.
+      The previous Hyperscript attempts had issues reliably preventing default input behavior. -->
  <script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
```

---

I've added the TODO comment above the JavaScript code in `assets/views/teams/invite.html`. This serves as a reminder to potentially refactor the keyboard navigation logic using only Hyperscript in the future.
