# Login Page Redirection Issue (2025-04-07 21:32:40)

_**User**_

the login page does not redirect correctly to the home page if the user is already authenticated. Instead a blak page is displayed

Okay, I see the issue. When an already authenticated user navigates directly to the `/auth/login` page (not via an HTMX request), the server correctly identifies the user. It then sends back a response with the `HX-Redirect: /home` header and an empty body.

However, the browser doesn't understand the `HX-Redirect` header on its own; that header is meant to be interpreted by the HTMX library on the client-side. Since the response body is empty and HTMX isn't involved in processing this direct navigation response, the browser simply displays the empty body, resulting in a blank page.

According to your rules, HTMX redirects (`HX-Redirect` or `HX-Location`) are preferred. But in this specific case (a direct, non-HTMX GET request by an authenticated user), a standard HTTP redirect is required for the browser to navigate correctly.

I'll modify the `login` function to return a standard HTTP 302 redirect when the user is already authenticated.

First, I need to read the relevant part of the file to ensure the edit context is correct.

Read file: src/controllers/auth_pages.rs

Okay, I understand the issue. The current implementation uses `HX-Redirect`, which is intended for HTMX-driven interactions, not standard browser navigation. When an already authenticated user directly visits the login page, the browser doesn't interpret `HX-Redirect`, leading to the blank page.

I will modify the `login` function in `src/controllers/auth_pages.rs` to use a standard HTTP redirect when an authenticated user accesses the page directly. I'll also add the necessary import for `Redirect`.

```diff
  use loco_rs::prelude::*;
  use std::collections::HashMap;
+ use axum::response::Redirect;
  
  /// Renders the registration page
      match auth.user {
          Some(_user) => {
-             // User is already authenticated, redirect to home
+             // User is already authenticated, redirect to home using standard redirect
              tracing::info!("User is already authenticated, redirecting to home");
-             let response = Response::builder()
-                 .header("HX-Redirect", "/home")
-                 .body(axum::body::Body::empty())?;
-             Ok(response)
+             Ok(Redirect::to("/home").into_response())
          }
          None => {
```

The code in `src/controllers/auth_pages.rs` has been updated to use a standard HTTP redirect (`Redirect::to("/home")`) when an already authenticated user visits the `/auth/login` page. This should fix the blank page issue.

Now, as per our development process, I'll run `cargo check` and `cargo test` to ensure the changes compile correctly and don't break any existing tests.

Great! Both `cargo check` and `cargo test` passed successfully.

The change to use a standard HTTP redirect in the `login` function for already authenticated users has been applied correctly and doesn't seem to have introduced any new issues.

The login page should now correctly redirect authenticated users to `/home` when accessed directly.
