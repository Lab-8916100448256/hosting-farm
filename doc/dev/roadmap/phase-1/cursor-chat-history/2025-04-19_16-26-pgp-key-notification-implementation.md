# PGP Key Notification Implementation (2025-04-19 18:26:27)

_**User**_

The profile page should display a warning notification when the user has no public PGP key configured or when its public PGP key has not been verified. Make this notification similar to the one displayed on that same page when the user has not verified his email address. This is the `email-verification-banner-container` section of @profile.html 
The controller handler that is rendering the profile page template is `profile` in @users_pages.rs
The warning message should indicate that having a properly configured and verified PGP public key is an important security feature for using the application as it is used for password recovery and for encoding secrets.

Okay, I understand. I will modify the `profile` handler in `src/controllers/users_pages.rs` to determine if the user has a PGP key and if it's verified, and then update the `assets/views/users/profile.html` template to display a warning banner similar to the email verification one when the PGP key is missing or not verified.

First, I'll modify the `profile` handler.



---

```diff
      // Check for the pgp_verified query parameter
      let pgp_verified_success = params.get("pgp_verified") == Some(&"true".to_string());
+ 
+     // Determine PGP status flags
+     let has_pgp_key = user.pgp_key.is_some();
+     let is_pgp_verified = user.pgp_verified_at.is_some();
  
      render_template(
              "pgp_validity": &pgp_validity,
              "pgp_verified_success": pgp_verified_success,
+             "has_pgp_key": has_pgp_key,
+             "is_pgp_verified": is_pgp_verified,
          }),
      )
```

Now I'll add the warning banner to the template file.

```diff
                          <!-- PGP Key Section -->

+                             {% endif %}
                             {% include "users/_pgp_section.html" %}
                          </div>
```

I have added the necessary flags to the controller and the conditional warning banner to the profile template. This banner will now inform users if their PGP key is missing or unverified, explaining its importance for security.
