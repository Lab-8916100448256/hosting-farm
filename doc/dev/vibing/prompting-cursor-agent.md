Look in @auth_pages.rs for TODO comments and write a detailed plan in markdown format with check-boxes in a file named todo.md in doc/dev of all the steps required to implements these TODOs. Do not implement anything before having finished writing this plan.
Then iterate on the items of the plan, implementing and running tests for each one. Do not continue to the next next step before the current test is fully implemented and all unit tests are OK. Commit to git between each step of the plan.
And remember the prject rules I gave in the context.
