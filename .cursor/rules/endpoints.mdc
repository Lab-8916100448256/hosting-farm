# Endpoints naming and structure rules

## Introduction
This rule file provides guidelines related to API endpoints and human-facing endpoints in web application developement

## API Endpoints
- All API endpoints MUST be prefixed with `/api/`
- API endpoints MUST return JSON responses
- API endpoints MUST be defined in files under `src/controllers/` that end with `_api.rs`
- API endpoints MUST NOT render HTML templates
- API endpoints MUST use `format::json()` for responses
- API endpoints MUST handle errors by returning appropriate HTTP status codes with JSON responses

## Human-Facing Endpoints
- Human-facing endpoints MUST NOT be prefixed with `/api/`
- Human-facing endpoints MUST return either an HTML responses or an HTMX redirect through HX_Redirect or HX_Location header.
- Human-facing endpoints MUST be defined in files under `src/controllers/` that end with `_pages.rs`.
- Human-facing endpoints MUST use for response an HTML viewhandler .
- Human-facing endpoints handlers MUST never handle errors by returning an Error type. A normal HTML response with an error messages must be returned instead. Depending on the cases it can be : 
  - A full error page including an error messages in the places that cannot be rendered because of the failure for a standard endpoint that is serving non AJAX requests, using the template assets/views/error_page.html
  - an HTMX error fragment that will be inserted into an error container in the page from where the endpoint was called, for endpoints are serving AJAX requests. 
- Human-facing endpoints that are not returning any html fragment or full page MUST redirect to appropriate pages after successful actions. 
- For implementing a redirect in an html controller handler, the utility function `redirect(url: &str, headers: HeaderMap) -> Result<Response>` in `src/views/mod.rs` MUST be used.
- View rendering MUST not be implemented using any custom template rendering code that would directly call the Tera engine. There are utility functions that are doing that in src/views/mod.rs for normal pages and HTMX fragments as well as for error cases described above.
- Human-facing endpoints MUST use the custom authentication middleware of `auth_no_error` module to extract the authentication data from the requests
- Authenticated Human-facing endpoints MUST handle gracefully the case of a user calling them without being authenticated by redirecting the user to the login page. Once successfuly logged-in the user SHOULD be redirected to the endpoint he originaly called.

## Examples
- Examples of API endpoints implementation : src/controller/auth_api.rs 
- Example of human-facing endpoints and views implementation : src/controller/auth_pages.rs and assets/views/auth/*.html

### API Endpoint (Correct)
```rust
// In src/controllers/auth_api.rs
pub fn routes() -> Routes {
    Routes::new()
        .prefix("/api/auth")
        .add("/verify/{token}", get(verify))  // Returns JSON
}
```

### Human-Facing Endpoint (Correct)
```rust
// In src/controllers/auth_pages.rs
pub fn routes() -> Routes {
    Routes::new()
        .prefix("/auth")
        .add("/verify/{token}", get(verify_email))  // Returns HTML
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. ❌ Mixing API and human-facing endpoints in the same controller file
2. ❌ Using HTML templates in API endpoints
3. ❌ Using JSON responses in human-facing endpoints
4. ❌ Not properly prefixing API endpoints routes with `/api/`
5. ❌ Using form submissions in API endpoints
6. ❌ Using direct JSON responses in human-facing endpoints

## Verification Checklist
Before committing changes, verify that:
1. [ ] API endpoints are in files ending with `_api.rs`
2. [ ] Human-facing endpoints are in files ending with `_pages.rs`
3. [ ] API endpoints routes use `/api/` prefix
4. [ ] Human-facing endpoints do not use `/api/` prefix
5. [ ] API endpoints return JSON using `format::json()`
6. [ ] Human-facing endpoints use `format::render().view()`
7. [ ] No mixing of response types in the same controller file
