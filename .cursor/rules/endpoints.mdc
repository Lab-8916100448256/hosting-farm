# Endpoints naming and structure rules

## Introduction
This rule file provides guidelines related to API endpoints and human-facing endpoints in web application developement

## API Endpoints
- All API endpoints MUST be prefixed with `/api/`
- API endpoints MUST return JSON responses
- API endpoints MUST be defined in files under `src/controllers/` that end with `.rs`
- API endpoints MUST NOT render HTML templates
- API endpoints MUST use `format::json()` for responses
- API endpoints MUST handle errors by returning appropriate HTTP status codes with JSON responses

## Human-Facing Endpoints
- Human-facing endpoints MUST NOT be prefixed with `/api/`
- Human-facing endpoints MUST return HTML responses
- Human-facing endpoints MUST be defined in files under `src/controllers/` that end with `_pages.rs`
- Human-facing endpoints MUST use `render_template()` for responses
- Human-facing endpoints MUST handle errors by re-rendering the template with error messages
- Human-facing endpoints MUST use form submissions for data input
- Human-facing endpoints MUST redirect to appropriate pages after successful actions

## Examples

### API Endpoint (Correct)
```rust
// In src/controllers/auth.rs
pub fn routes() -> Routes {
    Routes::new()
        .prefix("/api/auth")
        .add("/verify/{token}", get(verify))  // Returns JSON
}
```

### Human-Facing Endpoint (Correct)
```rust
// In src/controllers/auth_pages.rs
pub fn routes() -> Routes {
    Routes::new()
        .prefix("/auth")
        .add("/verify/{token}", get(verify_email))  // Returns HTML
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. ❌ Mixing API and human-facing endpoints in the same controller file
2. ❌ Using HTML templates in API endpoints
3. ❌ Using JSON responses in human-facing endpoints
4. ❌ Not properly prefixing API endpoints with `/api/`
5. ❌ Using form submissions in API endpoints
6. ❌ Using direct JSON responses in human-facing endpoints

## Verification Checklist
Before committing changes, verify that:
1. [ ] API endpoints are in files ending with `.rs`
2. [ ] Human-facing endpoints are in files ending with `_pages.rs`
3. [ ] API endpoints use `/api/` prefix
4. [ ] Human-facing endpoints do not use `/api/` prefix
5. [ ] API endpoints return JSON using `format::json()`
6. [ ] Human-facing endpoints use `render_template()`
7. [ ] No mixing of response types in the same controller file
