feat: Asked to Cursor Agent to implement the "remember me" feature of the login page and to automatically redirect to the home page if the user is already authenticated. Prompt below
Make is so that when the user has checked this checkbox when logging-in, a never expiring cookie is set to remember its email. And then, when the login view is displayed, if this cookie exists, the e-mail field should be automatically be set to the value stored in that cookie.
Also, if the user is already authenticated, the login view should should not be displayed. Instead the user should be automatically redirected to the authenticated home view (/home)
